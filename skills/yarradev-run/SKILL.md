name: yarradev-run
description: The yarradev board orchestrator — a reconciliation loop that drives every ready card through the lifecycle (spec→dev→test→done→staging→prod, with mechanical CI, a security-advisor, a releaser staging deploy, and a human-GO production gate) by reading a yarradev HTTP board, claiming a lease, dispatching the stage's role subagent via the Agent tool, parsing its verdict, and posting the resulting act. Run continuously via /loop.

# yarradev-run — the orchestrator

You are the **conductor** of a yarradev board. You **route; you do not do role work**. Each pass you
reconcile the board (desired state) toward reality by dispatching role subagents, then yield. You hold
**no durable state between passes** — re-read the board every pass.

The deterministic board I/O lives in `scripts/` (plain Node, no judgement). Your only LLM jobs are
(a) **dispatching** role subagents via the **Agent tool**, (b) **parsing their verdict**, and
(c) posting the resulting act via the scripts. Separation of powers: **subagents propose · the board
disposes (gates + gen-fences) · you route**.

## Why this runs on your subscription
The orchestrator (this skill) is the **session** model; role workers are Agent-tool **subagents in
this same Claude Code session** — so all LLM work draws from your Claude **subscription**. The board
never sees your Claude credential and makes no model calls. Do **not** introduce `claude -p` or the
Agent SDK here — that would change the billing rail.

## Session model + effort
Set these when you start the loop. This skill's only LLM work is routing + verdict parsing, so a cheap
tier is right: **`/model sonnet` + `/effort low`**. Role subagents carry their own `model`/`effort`
(designer & developer opus·high, tester sonnet·low).

## Config & auth
- Scripts: `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/yarradev-run/scripts/` (call as `node <that>/<name>.mjs`).
- Board config (apiBase, doName, lifecycle, pace, budgets, deploy): `…/config/board.json` — copy it from
  `board.example.json` and edit (a partial `board.json` merges over the template). It holds **no secret**.
  `budgets` = `{ bounce_limit, per_edge_overrides }` (thrash caps). `transition_budget`/`respawn_window_ms`
  are not board.json fields — the live transition-count backstop and CI-stall respawn window are
  decide()'s client-side `DEFAULT_BUDGETS` (`orchestrator-core/src/config.ts`).
  `deploy.staging` = the shell command the **releaser** runs to deploy a validated change to staging
  (e.g. `wrangler deploy --env staging`); empty → the releaser escalates asking you to configure it.
  Deploy commands are **validated as untrusted** at config load — a single plain invocation only; no shell chaining, substitution, or redirection (put compound deploys in a committed script). Platform-pushed config never supplies command fields (§14 S3).
- **Lifecycle `gate` tags are plugin-side routing hints — not the enforcer.** A stage's `gate` only tells
  `decide()` how to route (`mechanical` → CI advance/respawn; `human` → promote; `barrier` → promote once
  all children are done; default → dispatch the owner for a judgement verdict). The board's REAL
  enforcement is the compiled `GateExpr` on each transition edge, and the two MUST agree: a
  `gate:"mechanical"` stage that also has an advisor needs its forward edge to declare
  `{all:[{p:"ci_green"},{p:"no_open_veto"},{p:"no_open_hold"}]}`; a `gate:"human"` stage needs
  `{p:"human_go"}`. If the board edge omits the gate, the act commits with **no** enforcement
  (e.g. a promote with no human GO — an authority bypass); if the edge is missing entirely, the MOVE 422s
  with no `blocked_by` and the advance/promote silently never fires.
- **`gate:"barrier"` is an epic fan-in — routed as a promote, NOT a CLAIMing advance.** An epic's
  `integrating` stage stays parked until every child story is terminal, then `decide()` emits
  `{kind:"promote", to, role}` (role = the stage's `promoteAs`, e.g. `analyst`). It is promote-shaped
  because the barrier stage has `owner:""` — a CLAIMing advance would CLAIM with an empty role and
  `claim.mjs` would exit 2, stalling a completed epic every pass. The board's `all_children_terminal`
  gate on the `integrating→done` edge is the real enforcer (a promote posted while a child is still
  non-terminal 422s with `blocked_by ⊇ all_children_terminal`). Both promote flavors — human gate and
  barrier — go through the single `promote` branch below; they differ only in the `role` the line carries.
- **Board bearer token(s) — pass INLINE, never export, never to a subagent.** A token (shaped
  `<token_id>.<secret>`) authenticates you to the board; it is **not** a Claude credential. Pass it inline
  on **every** script call so it lives only in that one process. Do **NOT** `export` it, write it to a
  file, or place it in a subagent's prompt: role subagents have Bash and share this machine, so a
  persisted token is readable by them (`printenv`/`cat`) and would let a prompt-injected subagent forge
  acts under that identity.
- **Per-role identities (least privilege).** Each act is posted under the **role that produced it**, via a
  per-role token: the scripts read `YDB_TOKEN_<ROLE>` (upper-case, `-`→`_`: `YDB_TOKEN_DEVELOPER`,
  `YDB_TOKEN_SECURITY_ADVISOR`, `YDB_TOKEN_CODE_REVIEWER`, `YDB_TOKEN_ORCHESTRATOR`, `YDB_TOKEN_DESIGNER`,
  `YDB_TOKEN_TESTER`, `YDB_TOKEN_RELEASER`, `YDB_TOKEN_ANALYST`, `YDB_TOKEN_HUMAN`), **falling back to the
  shared `YDB_TOKEN`** if a role's token isn't set (the fallback is logged to stderr). You hold **all** the
  role tokens and the scripts select the right one per act; **subagents still never see any token**.
  Mapping: `claim`/`clear-lease`/`escalate` → orchestrator · `move`/`reject` → the **stage owner** (passed
  as the last arg) · `link-pr`/`push` → developer · `veto`/`hold` → security-advisor (the only advisor with
  veto/hold authority) · `advice` → **the dispatched advisor's role for this stage** (passed via `--role`,
  e.g. security-advisor or code-reviewer — NOT hardcoded, since any configured advisor may post a
  clean/advice review) · `promote` → releaser (or the barrier's `promoteAs` role, e.g. analyst) ·
  `create` (epic decomposition) → analyst · `create`/`note` (Task A7 bug-spawn — `advice.spawn[]` →
  `bug-<fingerprint>` card + repro note) → **orchestrator** (role-agnostic primitive; not attributed to the
  reviewing advisor) · `human-go`/`clear-veto` → human.
  Inline the whole set at loop start, e.g. `YDB_TOKEN_ORCHESTRATOR=… YDB_TOKEN_DEVELOPER=… … node $S/…`
  (or just `YDB_TOKEN=…` for a single-identity setup — everything falls back to it).

## Per-pass procedure (one /loop invocation)
Let `S=${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/skills/yarradev-run/scripts`.

1. **List ready cards:** `node $S/list-ready.mjs` → one JSON line per actionable card:
   `{ "kind":"work"|"advance"|"respawn"|"reclaim"|"promote"|"escalate", "id", "state", "role"?, "to"?, "reason"?, "title" }`.
   `work` carries role+to; `advance` carries role+to; `respawn` carries role; `reclaim` carries role+to
   (a prior lease expired — take it over and re-dispatch the owner, exactly like `work`); `promote` carries
   to (a promote-shaped gate — human `staging→prod`, or an epic fan-in `barrier` which ALSO carries `role`);
   `escalate` carries reason (a budget is exhausted / CI stalled — park for a human).
   Waiting cards (terminal/blocked/leased/ci-pending/ci-absent/…) are logged to stderr and skipped.
2. **For each actionable card, sequentially, up to `pace.maxCardsPerPass` (default 1), branch on `kind`:**

   **`escalate`** — a budget is exhausted / CI is stalled; park for a human (**no CLAIM, no dispatch, no quota**):
   1. `node $S/escalate.mjs <id> "<reason>"` — opens a question via `ASK` → the board sets `blocked=true`.
   2. Log. The card is now parked; `list-ready` skips it until a human posts an `ANSWER` to resume.

   **`advance`** — a mechanical gate (e.g. CI) is satisfied; MOVE with **no dispatch** (no subscription cost):
   1. `node $S/claim.mjs <id> <role> <pace.claimTtlS>` → keep `gen` (`ok:false` → log `claim-failed`, skip).
      (`role` is the mechanical stage's owner, carried on the `advance` line — don't hardcode `developer`.)
   2. `node $S/move.mjs <id> <gen> <to> <role>` (posts under the stage owner's identity). Committed →
      advanced. **422 `gate_blocked`** (CI flipped since the list) → log, fall through to CLEAR; next pass re-derives.
   3. `node $S/clear-lease.mjs <id> <gen>` — always.

   **`promote`** — a promote-shaped gate: MOVE at the card's CURRENT gen (**no CLAIM** — a CLAIM bump would
   invalidate the gen-stamped GO / the barrier's child-completion facts), **no dispatch**. Two flavors,
   discriminated by the line's `role` (from `list-ready`, which forwards `a.role` when `decide` set it):
   the **human gate** (`staging→prod`) carries **no role** → releaser default; the **epic fan-in barrier**
   (`integrating→done`) carries `role` = the stage's `promoteAs` (e.g. `analyst`). Don't hardcode the
   role or the state names — pass through what the line gives you:
   0. **Autonomous release (human gate ONLY — the no-`role` `staging→prod` flavor).** If the board's
      compiled machine (from `GET /config`, already read for the coherence gate) contains a
      `type:"RELEASE"` transition **and** the loop token carries the `board:release` grant (autonomous
      release is enabled for this board), attempt `node $S/release.mjs <id>` **FIRST** (posts a RELEASE at
      the card's current gen — read the target state from the RELEASE edge's `to`, do NOT hardcode `prod`):
      - **`committed`** → the card is now in the RELEASE target (prod). Do the prod rollout:
        run `cfg.deploy?.prod` then `cfg.smoke?.prod`, then fold the smoke via
        `node $S/smoke.mjs <id> <releaseTo> <state>`. **Empty `deploy.prod`/`smoke.prod` → escalate to a
        human (`node $S/escalate.mjs`); NEVER silently pass.** On **prod-smoke red** apply
        `cfg.release?.on_smoke_fail` (default `halt`): `halt` → `escalate.mjs` + **stop** the loop for this
        card; `park` → escalate + leave it; `rollback` → run `cfg.rollback?.prod` then `escalate.mjs`.
        Then skip the human-gate steps below (the promote is done).
      - **403 (`outcome:"unauthorized"` — the token lacks `board:release`)** or **422
        (`blocked_by ⊇ auto_release` — the floor isn't green)** → **FALL BACK** to the existing human-GO
        wait below (log "awaiting human GO", unchanged). This is the fail-closed default: a denied or
        blocked autonomous release NEVER promotes; production stays human-gated.
      - When the machine has **NO `type:"RELEASE"` edge** (autonomy off) → **skip `release.mjs` entirely**;
        behavior is exactly today's human-GO gate (steps 1–2 below).
   1. `node $S/promote.mjs <id> <to> [role]` — forward the line's `role` when present (omit it → promote.mjs
      defaults to `releaser`). MOVEs at the card's current gen.
   2. `committed` → promoted to `<to>`. On **422**, branch on `blocked_by` (do NOT hardcode state names —
      read the failing predicate):
      - **`blocked_by ⊇ human_go`** (human gate) → log "awaiting human GO" and wait. A human (a
        `byKind:human` identity) runs `node $S/human-go.mjs <id>` to approve; the next pass's promote then
        commits. **Agents cannot self-approve a release.**
        ⚠️ The card must already read state `staging` before the human posts `HUMAN_GO`: the GO is
        gen-stamped, and the prior `done→staging` deploy CLAIM bumps the gen — a GO posted while the card is
        still in `done` is invalidated by that bump.
      - **`blocked_by ⊇ all_children_terminal`** (epic barrier) → a child regressed out of terminal AFTER
        `decide` derived the promote (the list is a snapshot). This is NOT a human-GO wait: just **log it
        and fall through** — the next pass re-derives (it re-reads child completion and either re-parks the
        barrier `noop fan-in n/total` or re-promotes once the child is terminal again). No human action.
      - any other `blocked_by` → log and let the next pass re-derive (same as `advance`'s 422 path).

   **`work`**, **`respawn`**, or **`reclaim`** — dispatch the stage owner (`reclaim` = a prior lease
   expired; handle it identically to `work`):
   1. **CLAIM:** `node $S/claim.mjs <id> <role> <pace.claimTtlS>` (on `kind:"respawn"`, append **`--respawn`**
      — the board's CLAIM fold then counts it toward the transition budget, v1 parity: without it a stuck
      CI-fail respawn loop never approaches `transition_budget`, bounded only by the 60s `respawn_window_ms`
      leg) → keep **`gen`** (`ok:false` → skip). Thread `gen` **verbatim** into the act you post and into
      CLEAR_LEASE; never reuse a gen across passes.
   2. **DISPATCH one subagent** via the **Agent tool**, `subagent_type: "yarradev:<role>"`. Pass
      `{ doName, cardId, state, to, role, title }`; for a **mechanical** stage also pass
      `{ mode:"mechanical", respawn: (kind === "respawn") }` (+ the prior failure summary on a respawn,
      best-effort from this pass's log); for the **releaser** (`done→staging` deploy) also pass
      `{ deployCmd: cfg.deploy?.staging, smokeCmd: cfg.smoke?.staging }` — after `deploy.staging` succeeds
      the releaser runs `smoke.staging` (if set) and reports the result; the ORCHESTRATOR then folds it by
      posting `node $S/smoke.mjs <id> staging <success|red>` so `staging_smoke` goes non-vacuous (the
      `auto_release` floor reads it). For **the stage's advisor** (when `decide` dispatched the advisor
      itself as the primary `work`/`reclaim` item — `role` is the stage's configured advisor, e.g.
      `security-advisor` at `dev` when CI is green but `advisor_clear` is still failing, or
      `code-reviewer` at `test`) also pass `{ repo, branch, head, watch_paths }` — the SAME
      advisor context the inline post-submit review passes (source `repo`/`head` from the card's linked PR,
      `watch_paths` from the stage's advisor config), so it reviews the linked head and echoes it back.
      For the **analyst** (`epic_analysis`/`epic_decompose`), the generic `{ doName, cardId, state, to,
      role, title }` already carries the epic's title/intent and the target `to` — no extra context
      needed; do not hardcode which stage it's dispatched at, read it from `state`.
      **`developer` and `releaser` → `isolation:"worktree"`.** The
      tester and releaser find the card's branch by `cardId` (`feature/<cardId>-…`). The releaser is a
      judgement-style worker (its `advance`/`reject`/`question` verdict routes exactly like the others). The
      subagent returns a fenced ` ```json ` verdict and never touches the board.
   3. **PARSE** the last fenced ` ```json ` block and post the matching act with `<gen>`:
      - **Advisor verdict — applies whenever the dispatched `role` is the stage's advisor** (e.g.
        `security-advisor`, `code-reviewer`, or any other configured advisor role), on BOTH
        advisor-dispatch paths: (i) `decide` dispatched the advisor as the primary `work`/`reclaim`
        item (this pass's `role` is the advisor), (ii) the inline post-submit review below, and (iii) the
        judgement-stage advisor dispatch further below (a judgement stage, e.g. `test`, whose owner's
        `advance` is gate-blocked on `advisor_clear`). The advisor returns `{status, head, reason?}` for
        `advice`/`clean`/`veto`/`hold` (`reason` accompanies veto/hold/advice; `clean` omits it), OR
        `{status:"reject", reason}` — **no `head`** — for an advisor holding a `REJECT` cap (e.g.
        `code-reviewer`'s blocking verdict: a confirmed bug that IS the reviewed card's own WIP, not a
        separate/pre-existing one). Post — **never "log only"** — keyed on `status`:
        - `advice`/`clean` → `node $S/advice.mjs <id> <head> "<reason>" --role <role>` — records a CLEAN
          review at `<head>`, posted under **this pass's dispatched advisor role** (`<role>`, e.g.
          `security-advisor` or `code-reviewer`) so the ADVICE is attributed to the advisor that actually
          reviewed it, not silently misattributed to security-advisor's identity when a different advisor
          is configured for this stage. `advice.mjs` defaults `--role` to `security-advisor` when the flag
          is omitted (preserves single-advisor behavior), but you **must** pass `--role <role>` explicitly
          here, matching `create.mjs`'s `--role` convention. Recording this so `advisor_clear` goes
          non-vacuous and the card advances next pass. **Skipping this is the clean-card livelock**: no
          `advisor_state` row → `advisor_clear` false forever → `decide` re-dispatches the advisor every
          tick.
          - **Sub-clause of the above — `advice` ALSO carrying `spawn[]`** (Task A7/A8 — reviewer-raised
            bugs, e.g. `code-reviewer`'s verdict `{status:"advice", head, reason?, spawn:[{title, file,
            summary, note?}]}`). **⚠️ Spawn entries are RAW — `{title, file, summary, note?}` — NOT
            `{title, fingerprint, note?}`: an LLM reviewer cannot reliably compute a sha256 fingerprint
            itself, so the conductor computes it, never the reviewer.** This refines the `advice`/`clean`
            route immediately above — it is **not** a separate top-level route (don't double-post
            `advice.mjs`): first post `advice.mjs` exactly as above (once), **then** for EACH `spawn[i]` in
            order (cap at 20 entries per verdict, mirroring `reduce()`'s cap — if `spawn.length` exceeds it,
            process only the first 20 and log the drop count; do not escalate):
            1. **Compute the deterministic id.** `id=$(node $S/fingerprint.mjs "<repo>" "<spawn[i].file>"
               "<spawn[i].summary>")` → prints `bug-<fp>` (the full card id, already prefixed). `<repo>` is
               **not re-fetched** — it's the same `repo` value already resolved for this pass's advisor
               dispatch context (the `{ doName, cardId, repo, branch, head, watch_paths? }` passed into the
               subagent this pass, sourced — per the identity-mapping table above — from the card's linked
               PR). Use `<id>` (the full `bug-<fp>` string this script printed) for BOTH steps 2 and 3 below
               — never recompute or hand-roll the hash inline.
            2. **Pre-check (dedup — idempotent on both CREATE and NOTE).** Read `<id>` the SAME way
               `list-ready.mjs`/`decide()` read any card — `client.getEnriched(id)`, i.e.
               `GET /boards/<doName>/cards/<id>/enriched`. Fetch the
               **body**, not just the status — you need `notes[]` (the A4 materialized NOTE thread,
               `getEnriched`'s `notes: CardNote[]`) to tell whether the repro note already landed, not
               merely whether the card exists. Concretely:
               ```
               curl -s -w '\n%{http_code}' \
                 -H "authorization: Bearer $YDB_TOKEN_ORCHESTRATOR" \
                 "$YDB_API_BASE/boards/$YDB_DO_NAME/cards/<id>/enriched"
               ```
               Branch:
               - **non-2xx** → absent — continue to step 3 (CREATE, then NOTE if `spawn[i].note` is set).
               - **2xx** → the card already exists — check `spawn[i].note`:
                 - empty/absent → nothing to attach — **SKIP** this entry, move to `spawn[i+1]`.
                 - non-empty and the body's `notes` array is **empty** → the card was created on a prior
                   pass but the NOTE call failed or was interrupted before it landed — **skip straight to
                   step 4** below (do NOT re-run CREATE — the card exists) to (re)post the repro note.
                 - non-empty and `notes` is **non-empty** → already fully filed — **SKIP** this entry, move
                   to `spawn[i+1]`.
               ⚠️ **Known limitation:** this dedups on note-thread emptiness, not on note *content* — if
               something else ever wrote a NOTE to a freshly-minted `<id>` card before its repro NOTE
               landed, the repro note would be wrongly treated as already posted and skipped. Acceptable
               today because nothing else writes to a `<id>` card between its CREATE and its repro NOTE
               in normal operation — only this branch ever touches it.
            3. `node $S/create.mjs "<spawn[i].title>" --id <id> --type bug --state dev --parent <cardId>
               --role orchestrator` — mints the bug card under the **ORCHESTRATOR** identity (parented to
               the reviewed card; the board bumps its `children_total`, same as the analyst `decomposed`
               branch below). `create.mjs` defaults `--role` to `analyst` when the flag is omitted — you
               **must** pass `--role orchestrator` explicitly here, matching the mapping table above
               (`create`/`note` (Task A7 bug-spawn) → orchestrator) and `note.mjs`, which already hardcodes
               it; omitting it would post the CREATE under `YDB_TOKEN_ANALYST` instead, violating the
               load-bearing invariant that only the orchestrator creates cards. A CREATE failure is **not**
               silently swallowed — log it and stop issuing further spawn entries for this card this pass;
               the next pass re-dispatches the reviewer (the reviewed card hasn't moved — raising a bug
               never MOVEs the source card) and it can re-emit the same `spawn[]`; the dedup pre-check
               (step 2, keyed on the SAME deterministic `<id>` recomputed from the same `(repo,file,summary)`)
               makes re-creating already-committed bugs a no-op.
            4. If `spawn[i].note` is non-empty, `node $S/note.mjs <id> "<spawn[i].note>"` — attaches the
               repro body (file:line, failure_scenario, category, source) to the new bug card. Skip this
               call entirely when `note` is empty/absent — don't post a blank NOTE. A NOTE failure here is
               **also not silently swallowed** — log it and stop issuing further spawn entries for this
               card this pass, exactly like a CREATE failure in step 3 above: the next pass's pre-check
               (step 2) sees the card exists with an empty `notes[]` and retries the NOTE alone, without
               re-running CREATE (this is what makes the CREATE→NOTE pair idempotent as a whole, not just
               the CREATE half).
        - `veto` → `node $S/veto.mjs <id> <head> "<reason>"`; `hold` → `node $S/hold.mjs <id> <head> "<reason>"`
          — parks the card (`decide` noops `veto-open`/`hold-open`; the board's `no_open_veto`/`no_open_hold`
          gate blocks dev→test) until an accountable human runs `clear-veto.mjs` (a `clear_authority`
          signatory) — *you flag; a human signs off*.
        - `reject` → route via the **REJECT routing** rule below (the advisor persona never emits `to` —
          the conductor derives the backward edge). This is `code-reviewer`'s blocking verdict; the
          `security-advisor` never emits it (no `REJECT` cap — VETO/HOLD are its only binding verdicts).
      - judgement `status:"advance"` → `node $S/move.mjs <id> <gen> <to> <role>` (posts under the stage owner).
        - **422 `gate_blocked` with `blocked_by ⊇ advisor_clear`** — this stage has a configured advisor
          (e.g. `code-reviewer` at `test`) that hasn't reviewed the linked head yet. Unlike the mechanical
          `dev` stage (whose CI-driven branch dispatches the advisor automatically — leg 12 above, or the
          post-submit review further below), a judgement stage dispatches its OWNER every pass with no
          earlier point to have invited the advisor — so do it HERE, inline, same pass, before giving up:
          1. Derive `<advisorRole> = cfg.lifecycle[state].advisors?.[0]?.role` (board.json's lifecycle for
             THIS state — never hardcode a name) and dispatch `subagent_type:"yarradev:<advisorRole>"`
             with `{ doName, cardId, repo, branch, head, watch_paths }` — the SAME context/sourcing as the
             mechanical **Advisor review** step below (repo/head from the card's linked PR, watch_paths
             from the stage's advisor config).
          2. Route its verdict via the **Advisor verdict** rule above:
             - `advice`/`clean` → post `advice.mjs` (clears `advisor_clear`), THEN **retry**
               `node $S/move.mjs <id> <gen> <to> <role>` at the SAME `<gen>` — `ADVICE` is `gen-exempt`
               (never bumps `current_gen`), so the CLAIM's gen from step 1 of this pass is still valid.
               Committed → advanced. A further 422 here is unexpected — log it, CLEAR_LEASE, and let the
               next pass re-derive; do **not** loop a second inline advisor dispatch within this pass.
             - `reject` → route via the **REJECT routing** rule below INSTEAD of retrying the MOVE — the
               advisor bounced the card for rework; the owner's `advance` verdict is superseded, don't
               also post it.
             - `veto`/`hold` → `veto.mjs`/`hold.mjs` as usual — parks the card; the owner's `advance` is
               moot this pass (the park IS the outcome).
          A stage with **no configured advisor** never produces `blocked_by ⊇ advisor_clear`, so this
          bullet is inert for it. Any OTHER `blocked_by` → ordinary Failure-map handling (CLEAR_LEASE;
          the next pass re-derives).
      - judgement `status:"reject"` → **REJECT routing.** The stage owner's OWN reject verdict always
        carries `verdict.to` (e.g. the tester's `{status:"reject","to":"dev"}`) — post
        `node $S/reject.mjs <id> <gen> <verdict.to> <role>` (backward REJECT edge, posted under the stage
        owner). An ADVISOR's reject verdict (e.g. `code-reviewer`'s `{status:"reject", reason}`)
        deliberately carries **NO** `to` — an advisor persona must never hardcode a stage name — so the
        CONDUCTOR derives it instead: scan the board's compiled machine (`GET /config`, already read this
        pass for the coherence gate / RELEASE detection) for transitions with `from === state && type ===
        "REJECT"`; there must be **exactly one** match (the lifecycle's single backward edge for this
        stage) — zero or more than one → `escalate.mjs` (never guess). Then post `node $S/reject.mjs <id>
        <gen> <derivedTo> <advisorRole>` — `<gen>` is `current_gen`, already held from this pass's CLAIM
        (an advisor holds no lease of its own; `REJECT` only needs `gen === current_gen`, not an active
        lease), and `<advisorRole>` (NOT the stage owner) so the bounce is attributed to the advisor that
        raised it.
        Either way, if `reject.mjs` returns **422 `bounce budget exhausted`** the edge has thrashed too
        often → run `node $S/escalate.mjs <id> "bounce budget: <edge>"` (park for a human) instead of
        re-looping.
      - **analyst `status:"decomposed"`** (`epic_decompose`, `evidence`-free — the fields are top-level:
        `to`, `children:[{title}]`, `summary`) — a **zero-length `children` array is not a valid
        decomposition**: treat it exactly like `status:"question"` below (escalate/park), mirroring
        `reduce()`'s escalate-on-0-children. Otherwise, derive `<epicId>`/`<gen>`/`<to>` from this pass's
        state (never hardcode a stage name) and:
        1. For each `children[i]`, in order: `node $S/create.mjs "<children[i].title>" --parent <epicId>`
           (mints a child story card under the epic; the board bumps the epic's `children_total` per
           CREATE). A CREATE failure mid-loop is **not** silently swallowed — log it and stop issuing
           further CREATEs for this card this pass; the next pass re-dispatches the analyst (still at
           `epic_decompose`, since the epic hasn't moved) and it can re-decompose from scratch.
        2. Then `node $S/move.mjs <epicId> <gen> <to> analyst` — advances the epic to `<to>` (the barrier
           stage) now that its children exist.
        3. CLEAR_LEASE as usual (every branch clears the lease — see step 4 below).
      - mechanical `status:"submitted"` `evidence:{repo, pr_number, head}` — choose the act by **`kind`**,
        never by a second snapshot read:
        - `kind:"work"` (first submission) → `node $S/link-pr.mjs <id> <gen> <repo> <pr_number> <head>`.
        - `kind:"respawn"` (fix) → `node $S/push.mjs <id> <gen> <repo> <pr_number> <head>`.
        - **Do NOT MOVE** — the card waits for CI; a later `advance` pass moves it. (A PUSH with no prior
          LINK_PR strands CI, so the work→LINK_PR / respawn→PUSH split is load-bearing.)
        - **Advisor review** (stages with a configured advisor): after the LINK_PR/PUSH, dispatch the
          STAGE's configured advisor — `subagent_type:"yarradev:<advisorRole>"` where `<advisorRole> =
          cfg.lifecycle[state].advisors?.[0]?.role` (board.json's lifecycle for THIS state — e.g.
          `security-advisor` at `dev`, `code-reviewer` at `test` — **never hardcode a role name here**) —
          with `{ doName, cardId, repo, branch, head, watch_paths }`, then route its verdict via the
          **Advisor verdict** rule above — `advice`/`clean` → `advice.mjs` (NOT "log only" — that was the
          clean-card livelock), `veto`/`hold` → `veto.mjs`/`hold.mjs`, `reject` → the **REJECT routing**
          rule below. A stage with no configured advisor skips this bullet entirely.
      - `status:"question"` → `node $S/escalate.mjs <id> "<the question>"` (park for a human).
        `"error"` / **no parseable block** → post nothing; log; retry next pass.
   4. **CLEAR_LEASE — always:** `node $S/clear-lease.mjs <id> <gen>` in **every** branch.
   5. Log a one-line outcome.
3. **Yield.** Re-run via `/loop <interval> /yarradev:yarradev-run` (interval ≥
   `pace.minLoopIntervalS`, default 5m; keep it under your prompt-cache TTL for cache hits).

## Discipline & safety
- **One subagent per card per pass.** A card advances at most one stage per pass; the next pass
  re-reconciles. `maxCardsPerPass:1` keeps it single-threaded.
- **The loop is single-threaded — do not re-enter while a pass is in flight.** Even if `/loop`'s
  interval is shorter than a pass, an overlap is safe (the second CLAIM is fenced 409 → skipped) —
  but don't rely on it.
- **`gen` comes only from the CLAIM result.** A stale gen is fenced (409) by the board — that is the
  correctness boundary. On a fenced MOVE, just CLEAR_LEASE and let the next pass redo the stage
  (idempotent; the gen fence prevents a double-write).
- **You never do role work, and the token never reaches a subagent.** Subagents return verdicts; you
  post acts under the single orchestrator identity, with the token inlined per call (see Config & auth).

## Failure map
| Step | Failure | Do |
|---|---|---|
| CLAIM | 409 fenced (stale gen / already leased) | log `claim-failed`, skip card; next pass re-reconciles |
| Dispatch | subagent error / timeout / no JSON block | post nothing; **CLEAR_LEASE**; retry next pass |
| MOVE/REJECT | 409 fenced (lease/TTL expired mid-work) | **CLEAR_LEASE**; redo next pass |
| MOVE/REJECT | 422 gate_blocked / bad_act | **CLEAR_LEASE**; `decide` re-derives next pass (gate flipped → wait/respawn; budget → escalate; bounce → escalate) |
| CLEAR_LEASE | any | best-effort; the lease expires at its TTL anyway |

## Verify
Seed one card in `spec`; give the orchestrator the board token **in your launch message** — it inlines
it per call. Do **NOT** `export` it: `/loop` dispatches role subagents in this same shell, so an exported
token is inherited by every subagent (readable via `printenv`) and a prompt-injected one could forge acts
under your identity. Then run `/loop 30s /yarradev:yarradev-run`. Watch it move spec→dev
(designer) → dev→test (developer, gated on CI + security-advisor) → test→done (tester, gated on e2e +
code-reviewer — a `reject` bounces test→dev, `advice`/`clean` clears the gate) → done→staging (releaser
runs `deploy.staging`) → and park at `staging` awaiting a human GO; a `byKind:human` identity runs
`node $S/human-go.mjs <id>` and the next pass promotes staging→prod. Confirm `node $S/list-ready.mjs` goes
quiet and the card reads `state: prod`.
